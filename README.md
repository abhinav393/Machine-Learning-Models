# Machine-Learning-Models

This repository tracks my progress in learning Machine Learning Algorithms and the models I will develop with this knowledge. The code have comments for easy understanding.

# Machine Learning (ML) 
It is the study of computer algorithms that learn automatically via experience.
Tom M. Mitchell’s formal definition:
“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”
Machine Learning practitioners design algorithms which allow them to train computers to solve specific problems within a defined framework.

There are three types of machine learning approaches which are generally recognized:
  1. Supervised Learning
  2. Unsupervised Learning  
  3. Reinforcement Learning

# Supervised Learning
The computer is provided with a set of example inputs and their associated outputs and the goal is to learn a rule which maps inputs to outputs.[4]
  Examples: 
    Regression
      Predict a numerical output based on a set of inputs.
      Example: Predict the price of a house given its location, the year it was built, the size of home (in square feet or square meters), the size of the lot (if applicable), etc.
    Classification
      Predict an output label based on a set of inputs.
      Example: Given a picture of an animal, determine its species.
      Example: Predict whether a client will default on a loan based on their financial history.

# Unsupervised Learning
An algorithm is provided with an unlabeled set of data points and asked to find underlying structure or patterns in the data.
  Examples:
    Clustering
      Determine a grouping of objects such that objects within the group are more similar than those objects in other groups.
      Example: Anomaly detection (find data points which don’t align with the general trend of historical data)
      Example: In online advertising, use historical buying patterns or internet navigation patterns to find customers with similar interests.
    Component Analysis, Latent Space Analysis, etc.

# Reinforcement Learning
An agent interacts with an environment in which it seeks to achieve some goal. As the agent gains more experience, it learns to maximize observed rewards.
  Examples:
    Self-driving vehicles learn via simulated (and, later, real-world) experience to navigate safely from a starting point to a destination.
    Compute agents (or bots) which learn based on self-play to achieve superhuman performance in video and bored games.
